Folder where all code related to the bulk analysis, all the methods that will be used during the development of this project.

ts2cn stands for Time Series to Complex Network Epilepsy.

The code will be organized in modules.

- Time Series: Reading from file, methods of time series applied to time series, conversion of time series to complex networks
- Complex Network: Reading from file, methods of complex networks applied to complex networks (measure extraction, clustering ...)
- Pre-Processing: Pre-processing methods (Wavelet, Fourier, Filters, PCA, LDA, ICA, KDA ...)
- Pos-Processing: Pos-processing methods (Statistical analysis, ...)
- Plot: Methods related to plots
- Save: Methods related to saving (logs and saving contexts, partial and final results)
